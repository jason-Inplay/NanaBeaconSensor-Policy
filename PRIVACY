Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how NanoBeacon Thermostat (“the App”) handles information.

NanoBeacon Sensor App is developed by InPlay Inc. and is designed to work with InPlay IN120-based wireless temperature sensor hardware.

⸻

Information Collection and Use

NanoBeacon Sensor App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

Specifically, the App:
	•	Does not require user accounts or login
	•	Does not collect names, email addresses, or identifiers
	•	Does not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs
	•	Does not transmit data to external servers or cloud services

All processing happens locally on your device.

⸻

Bluetooth Usage

The App uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in scan-only (observer) mode to detect nearby IN120 temperature sensors.
	•	The App does not pair with or connect to devices
	•	BLE advertisement data (such as temperature and battery values) is processed locally
	•	Bluetooth data is not stored remotely or shared

Bluetooth access is required only to scan for compatible sensor broadcasts.

⸻

Data Storage

The App may store the following information locally on your device only:
	•	List of added sensors
	•	Custom sensor names
	•	User-configured display settings (such as temperature unit)

This data never leaves your device.

⸻

Third-Party Services

NanoBeacon Sensor App does not integrate with third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

The App relies only on standard Apple iOS system frameworks.

⸻

Children’s Privacy

NanoBeacon Sensor App does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

⸻

Security

Because the App does not collect or transmit personal data, the risk of data exposure is minimal.
