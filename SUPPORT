NanoBeacon Sensor App – Support

Thank you for using NanoBeacon Sensor App.

This app is designed to work with InPlay IN120–based wireless temperature sensor hardware. Below you’ll find answers to common questions and troubleshooting steps.

⸻

Hardware Requirement

NanoBeacon Sensor App requires compatible IN120 temperature sensor hardware to display live data.

The app:
	•	Scans nearby IN120 sensors using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertising
	•	Does not connect to sensors via traditional Bluetooth pairing
	•	Operates in BLE scan (observer) mode only

If no compatible sensor is nearby, the app will display “No device found.”

⸻

Getting Started
	1.	Power on your IN120 temperature sensor
	2.	Place the sensor within Bluetooth range
	3.	Open the IN120 Thermostat app
	4.	Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your iPhone
	5.	Tap Add Sensor to scan and add nearby devices

Once added, the sensor will appear on the dashboard and update automatically when broadcasts are received.

⸻

Bluetooth Troubleshooting

If no devices appear:
	•	Ensure Bluetooth is enabled in iOS Settings
	•	Grant Bluetooth permission when prompted
	•	Keep the sensor powered on and nearby
	•	Avoid Bluetooth interference from other devices
	•	Relaunch the app if needed

If Bluetooth is turned off, the app will prompt you to enable it.

⸻

Duplicate or Jumping Devices During Scan

During scanning, BLE advertising packets may be received frequently.

The app:
	•	Deduplicates devices using unique identifiers
	•	Stabilizes scan results to prevent items from jumping
	•	Updates signal strength and “last seen” timestamps in real time

If you see multiple entries with the same device name, allow a few seconds for the list to stabilize.

⸻

Temperature Data Notes
	•	Temperature values are broadcast by the sensor hardware
	•	Update frequency depends on sensor configuration
	•	Displayed values reflect the most recent broadcast received
	•	Data is intended for monitoring and demonstration purposes

⸻

Device Settings

Each sensor maintains independent settings, including:
	•	Temperature parsing parameters
	•	Custom display names
	•	Unit selection (°C / °F)

Settings are stored locally on your device.

⸻

App Limitations
	•	The app does not function without compatible IN120 hardware
	•	No cloud sync or remote access is provided
	•	No user accounts or login are required

⸻

Privacy

NanoBeacon Sensor App:
	•	Does not collect personal data
	•	Does not transmit sensor data to servers
	•	Stores settings locally on your device

See the Privacy Policy for full details.
